## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I noticed the finished design vs. the hsl color given in the style guide seemed to be off. I confirmed this by checking out other submitted solutions and noticed the purplish color was lighter for those submitted designs as well. Converting the given hsl to its rgba match was not accurate. I instead tried finding an rgba in the linear gradient property that would match, by eyeing it at different times with fresh eyes. While this may not have been the most efficient method, I wanted to match the color more closely since the purple tints were so drastically different between the style guide and actual end design. While not exact, my end rgba color is closer than the given hsl. 


### Continued development

In the future, I'd like to focus more on a mobile-first workflow. Though I used that mentality for this project, it could be stronger in regards to mobile-first.
